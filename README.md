# QuantumPredict - Exploring Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms

QuantumPredict is a TypeScript-based project designed to provide a platform for exploring and implementing quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. The repository aims to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum computing concepts and practical software development, enabling researchers and developers to experiment with cutting-edge algorithms and analyze their performance. This project is intended to be a modular and extensible framework, making it easy to contribute new algorithms and integrate with existing quantum computing simulators and hardware.

The primary goal of QuantumPredict is to demystify QML by providing well-documented and easily accessible implementations of popular algorithms. These implementations are built with a focus on clarity and efficiency, allowing users to understand the underlying quantum circuits and their behavior. The project also includes tools for benchmarking and comparing different algorithms, helping users to identify the most suitable approach for their specific problems. Furthermore, QuantumPredict aims to be platform-agnostic, allowing it to be used with a variety of quantum computing backends, from cloud-based simulators to actual quantum processors. This allows developers to experiment with quantum algorithms without being tied to a specific hardware provider.

QuantumPredict distinguishes itself by focusing on providing a high-quality TypeScript codebase, adhering to modern software engineering best practices. This ensures that the project is maintainable, testable, and easy to contribute to. TypeScript's strong typing system helps to prevent errors and improve code reliability. The project also emphasizes comprehensive documentation, providing detailed explanations of the algorithms and their implementations. This makes it easier for users to learn about QML and to adapt the project to their own needs. The modular architecture of QuantumPredict allows users to easily extend the project with new algorithms and features.

## Key Features

*   **Quantum Circuit Simulator:** A built-in simulator allows users to execute quantum circuits on their local machines without requiring access to quantum hardware. This simulator supports various quantum gates and measurement operations.
*   **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE):** An implementation of the VQE algorithm for finding the ground state energy of a quantum system. The implementation is parameterized to allow for different ansatz circuits and optimization algorithms. Uses `math.js` for complex number operations.
*   **Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM):** A QSVM implementation that leverages quantum feature maps to improve classification accuracy. This includes implementations of several common feature maps, such as the ZZFeatureMap. Utilizes kernel methods implemented through a custom linear algebra library.
*   **Quantum Neural Networks (QNN):** A framework for building and training QNNs. This includes support for different types of quantum layers and activation functions. Leverages gradient descent optimization implemented in TypeScript.
*   **Benchmarking Suite:** A suite of tools for benchmarking the performance of different QML algorithms. This includes metrics such as runtime, accuracy, and resource utilization. Implemented using `node-benchmark`.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** The project is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy to add new algorithms, features, and quantum computing backends. New algorithms are implemented as classes implementing a standard interface.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation is provided for all algorithms and features, including explanations of the underlying quantum concepts. Documentation generated using `typedoc`.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language for the project, providing strong typing and improved code maintainability.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing the TypeScript code.
*   **npm/Yarn:** Package managers for managing project dependencies.
*   **math.js:** A comprehensive math library for performing numerical computations, particularly for handling complex numbers in quantum circuit simulations.
*   **typedoc:** A documentation generator for TypeScript projects, used to create comprehensive API documentation.
*   **node-benchmark:** A library used for benchmarking the performance of QML algorithms.
*   **jest:** A JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration testing of the QuantumPredict codebase.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumPredict.git
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    cd QuantumPredict
3.  **Install dependencies using npm or yarn:**
    npm install
    or
    yarn install
4.  **Compile the TypeScript code:**
    npm run build
    or
    yarn build

## Configuration

QuantumPredict uses environment variables to configure certain aspects of the project, such as the quantum computing backend to use and the level of logging.

*   `QUANTUM_BACKEND`: Specifies the quantum computing backend to use (e.g., "simulator", "ibm_quantum"). Defaults to "simulator".
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the level of logging (e.g., "debug", "info", "warn", "error"). Defaults to "info".
*   `IBM_QUANTUM_API_TOKEN`: Required if using the "ibm_quantum" backend. Your IBM Quantum API token.
*   `IBM_QUANTUM_SERVICE_URL`: Optional. Allows the specification of a custom IBM Quantum service endpoint.

You can set these environment variables in your `.env` file or directly in your terminal.

For example, create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

QUANTUM_BACKEND=ibm_quantum
LOG_LEVEL=debug
IBM_QUANTUM_API_TOKEN=YOUR_IBM_QUANTUM_API_TOKEN

## Usage

After installation and configuration, you can use QuantumPredict to run various QML algorithms. Here are a few examples:

*Example 1: Running the VQE algorithm*

//Import the VQE class
import { VQE } from './src/algorithms/VQE';

//Create an instance of the VQE algorithm
const vqe = new VQE();

//Set the Hamiltonian for the system
const hamiltonian = [[1, 0], [0, -1]];

//Run the VQE algorithm
const result = await vqe.run(hamiltonian);

//Print the result
console.log(result);

*Example 2: Running the QSVM algorithm*

//Import the QSVM class
import { QSVM } from './src/algorithms/QSVM';

//Create an instance of the QSVM algorithm
const qsvm = new QSVM();

//Define the training data
const trainingData = [[[0, 0], 0], [[0, 1], 1], [[1, 0], 1], [[1, 1], 0]];

//Train the QSVM model
await qsvm.train(trainingData);

//Define the test data
const testData = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]];

//Predict the labels for the test data
const predictions = await qsvm.predict(testData);

//Print the predictions
console.log(predictions);

API documentation can be generated using the command: `npm run docs` or `yarn docs`. This will create a `docs` folder with HTML files containing the API documentation.
